# Random Colors

This project is build under react101 course from codecademy
The background of the app will change to a random color every time the button is pressed.
The purpose is to practice the props and state features of react in order to see how components interact with each other

## Task 1

Have a look at the Random component class. Random's job is to store a random color, and to use that color to update the screen background.
First, let's store this random color as state.
Give Random a constructor() method. Give constructor() one parameter, named props.
Inside the body of constructor(), write super(props); and set the state with color: [x,y,z] with x,y,z replaced by some numbers

## Task 2

Change the three numbers inside color to see a different color as background

## Task 3

In the render() method, inside of the header (h1) tag, add the text, your color is _. Instead of _, access this.state.color!

## Task 4

In Random, find the method named formatColor. This method transforms an rgb array into something a bit more readable.
Inside the header tag, instead of simply using this.state.color, call the formatColor function and pass in this.state.color as an argument

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
